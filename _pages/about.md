I am a second-year PhD student in Physics at Cornell University, currently working with Prof. Chao-Ming Jian.

My research interests lie primarily in condensed matter physics. In particular, I am interested in non-equilibrium physics, quantum information dynamics, and strongly correlated systems. In my spare time, I play soccer, cook, and hike.
