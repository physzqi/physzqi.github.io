Hello there! My name is Zihao Qi (齐子皓). I am a third-year PhD student in Physics at Cornell University. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Christopher Earls](https://earls.cee.cornell.edu/). Prior to Cornell, I completed my undergraduate degree in Physics at Caltech.

I am currently working at the intersection of physics and machine learning. I am interested in using physical principles to understand machine learning algorithms and applying machine learning to problems in physics. In the past, I have primarily worked on problems in theoretical condensed matter physics. I have studied non-equilibrium dynamics, Floquet prethermalization, quantum information scrambling, and various lattice models.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing soccer, card and board games, and hiking around Ithaca.

11/2024: I have joined the group of Prof. Christopher Earls and will be a member of Cornell SciAI Center!

07/2024: Our recent [paper](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.014309), which defines a real-space topological invariant for time-quasi-periodic superconducting systems (with dense energy spectra!), was published in PRB as an Editors' Suggestion.
