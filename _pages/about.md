Hello there! My name is Zihao Qi (齐子皓). I am a fourth-year PhD Candidate in [Physics at Cornell University](https://physics.cornell.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Christopher Earls](https://earls.cee.cornell.edu/). Prior to Cornell, I completed my undergraduate degree in Physics at [Caltech](https://pma.caltech.edu/research-and-academics/physics), where I worked with Prof. [Gil Refael](https://pma.caltech.edu/people/gil-refael) and Prof. [John Preskill](https://www.preskill.caltech.edu/).

I am currently working at the intersection of physics and machine learning. In one direction, I explore how tools in machine learning can be applied for scientific discovery, particularly for problems in condensed matter physics and quantum information. More recently, I have become interested in using physical principles to design machine learning architectures and provide insights into the inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs). In the past, I have studied non-equilibrium quantum systems, Floquet prethermalization, quantum information dynamics, and various lattice models.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing soccer, card and board games, and hiking around Ithaca.

10/2025: I attended the KITP Conference _Frontiers of Programmable Quantum Dynamics: Advances and Applications_ and presented a [poster](https://physzqi.github.io/KITP_Poster.pdf) on how Fourier Neural Operators serve as a computational surrogate for quantum dynamics.

09/2025: Our [recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07084) proposes using Fourier Neural Operators as an effective, accurate, and scalable surrogate model for Floquet quantum dynamics, with potential applications to processing measurements from NISQ devices -- check it out!

08/2025: I have passed the Admission to Candidacy Exam and will be awarded a Master's degree in Physics.

03/2025: I attended the APS Global Physics Summit in Anaheim, CA and presented our work on the real-space topological invariant for time-quasiperiodic Majoranas. The slides are available [here](https://physzqi.github.io/MM_25.pdf).

11/2024: I have joined the group of Prof. Christopher Earls in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Cornell!

07/2024: Our [recent paper](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.014309), which defines a real-space topological invariant for time-quasi-periodic superconducting systems (whose energy spectra is _dense_!), has now been published in PRB as an Editors' Suggestion.
