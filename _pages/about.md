I am a second-year PhD student in Physics at Cornell University, currently working with Prof. Chao-Ming Jian. Prior to Cornell, I completed my undergraduate degree in Physics at Caltech.

My research interests lie broadly in non-equilibrium dynamics and quantum information science. In the past, I have studied time-quasiperiodic systems, Floquet prethermalization, quantum information scrambling, and frustrated lattice systems. 

In my spare time, I enjoy playing soccer, cooking, and hiking around Ithaca.
