Hello there! My name is Zihao Qi (齐子皓). I am a third-year PhD student in Physics at Cornell University. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Chris Earls](https://earls.cee.cornell.edu/). Prior to Cornell, I completed my undergraduate degree in Physics at Caltech.

I am currently working at the intersection of physics and machine learning as a part of [SciAI Center](https://sciaicenter.engineering.cornell.edu/events/) at Cornell. In particular, I am interested in applying physical models to understand the mechanism of machine learning algorithms. In the past, I have studied non-equilibrium systems, Floquet prethermalization, quantum information scrambling, and frustrated lattice systems.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing soccer, hiking around Ithaca, and board games.

07/2024: Our recent [paper](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.014309), which defines a real-space topological invariant for time-quasi-periodic superconducting systems (with dense energy spectra!), was published in PRB as an Editors' Suggestion.
