Hello there! My name is Zihao Qi (齐子皓). I am a fourth-year PhD Candidate in [Physics at Cornell University](https://physics.cornell.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Christopher Earls](https://earls.cee.cornell.edu/). Prior to Cornell, I completed my undergraduate degree in Physics at [Caltech](https://pma.caltech.edu/research-and-academics/physics), where I worked with Prof. [Gil Refael](https://pma.caltech.edu/people/gil-refael) and Prof. [John Preskill](https://www.preskill.caltech.edu/).

I am currently working at the intersection of physics and machine learning. In one direction, I am interested in applying tools in machine learning to problems in condensed matter physics. More recently, I have become interested in using physical insights to design machine learning architectures and understand the inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs). In the past, I have studied non-equilibrium quantum systems, Floquet prethermalization, quantum information dynamics, and various lattice models.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing soccer, card and board games, and hiking around Ithaca.

09/2025: Our work on Fourier Neural Operators for Floquet Quantum Dynamics has now been posted on arXiv -- check it out!

08/2025: I have passed the Admission to Candidacy Exam and will be awarded a Master's degree.

03/2025: I attended the APS Global Physics Summit in Anaheim, CA and presented our work on the real-space topological invariant for time-quasiperiodic Majoranas. The slides are available [here](https://physzqi.github.io/MM_25.pdf).

11/2024: I have joined the group of Prof. Christopher Earls in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Cornell!

07/2024: Our recent [paper](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.014309), which defines a real-space topological invariant for time-quasi-periodic superconducting systems (with dense energy spectra!), has been published in PRB as an Editors' Suggestion.
