Hello there! My name is Zihao Qi (齐子皓). I am a second-year PhD student in Physics at Cornell University, currently working with Prof. Chao-Ming Jian. Prior to Cornell, I completed my undergraduate degree in Physics at Caltech.

My research interests lie broadly in non-equilibrium physics, condensed matter systems, and quantum information science. In the past, I have studied time-quasiperiodic systems, Floquet prethermalization, quantum information scrambling, and frustrated lattice systems. 

In my spare time, I enjoy playing soccer, hiking around Ithaca, and board games.

07/2024: Our recent [paper](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.014309), which defines a real-space topological invariant for time-quasi-periodic superconducting systems (which have dense energy spectra!), was published in PRB as an Editors' Suggestion.
