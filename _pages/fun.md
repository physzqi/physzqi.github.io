Soccer
====
I am a member of Cornell CDSC (Chinese Dragon Soccer Club). I have travelled with the team and competed in a few Ivy Cup Tournaments as the starting Center Back. During the school year, I regularly play intramural games (indoor and outdoor), as well as pickup soccer.

Board and Card Games
====
* **Poker**: In 2018, I finished in the money in Caltech's Poker Tournament. I am currently an active member of Cornell's Poker Club. More recently, I won the 2025 Cornell X SOPO Tournament. I occasionally play cash games with friends as a pastime.
* **Bridge**: I was a member of Caltech's Bridge Club and competed in the 2020 Collegiate Bridge Championship (our team placed 4th in the nation!). Happy to discuss bidding conventions any time.
* **Legends of the Three Kingdoms (三国杀)**: I am an avid player of the Legends of Three Kingdoms, a board game based on the semi-fictional novel _Romance of the Three Kingdoms_. In Season 4 of 2024, I was ranked Top 100 of the game. In my spare time, I livestream on and upload game clips to [Bilibili](www.bilibili.com).
